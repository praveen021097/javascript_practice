// immutable

var str = "Praveen";

//basically string  collection of characters and it store the characters by array format and array stores value by index format 
//  so in array if we change or reassign the value so we change by index number
// let see here

var arr =["hi", "bye", "kay"];
arr[0]= "kalua";
console.log(arr) // value of arr ["kalua","bye",kay];

// if we want to change value of string its not possible '

// lets see her 

str[2] = "s";

console.log(str) // value of str still Praveen


//Number 

// number is help us to calculate arithmetic problems .number is numeric value 
// in js they provide us built in methods to calculate by using Math object;

// and one important thing in javascript we do not need to specify the data type of declaring a variable
// because javascript is loosely typed ans dynamic language

// Boolean 
// boolean is very less memory consumptable data type because it take only i bit
// its value either 0,or 1, 0 means falsy value , or 1 meas truly 

// Null 
// Null is very important data type it shows the existence of data inside not primitive data type specially Objects 
//null means container of data types available but there is not data it means container is empty;

// Undefined 

// Undefined is a special value thats shows us if you are not assigning any value declaring time javascript
// automatically assign Undefined behind the seen have a good story
