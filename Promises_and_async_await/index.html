        <h1>Callback Function</h1>
        <p>as we covered Callback function in function tutorial but today we go deep down in this concept 
            so Callback is function that pass as argument in a function 
            <br>
            callback means call me back 
            <br>
            people have a misunderstanding about callback function that is callback always behave like 
            asynchronously but it not true it depend on where are using if used for getting data and files and times it behave like asynchronously
            if you use in higher order function it behave synchronously.
            we see in index.js file how handle callback async operations and how it convert in callback hell
