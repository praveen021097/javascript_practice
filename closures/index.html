            <h1>Closures</h1>
            <p>closures is combination of function together bundling the reference of lexical environment /scope 
                in other words <q> function with bundle with lexical scope is called closures</q>
                and one more definition closures create lexical environment to inner function after executing outer function it mens outer and parent function/scope members (data ,variable) available after its executing
            </p>
            <p>
                i have lots of things for ta;king about closures because it very useful concept many experienced developer stuck here and itching his head ;
                we know javascript follow prototype inheritance
                very block scope has a lexical scope because it create when global  execution context run create  ;

                a function inside another function that is its lexical scope . and outer function has a lexical scope that is global scope.
